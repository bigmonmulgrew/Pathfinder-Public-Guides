# Pathfinder-Public-Guides
A repository for shared public guides for pathfinder 1e

## Introduction
As per the discussion here https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/14jtcjb/pathfinder_guides_preservation/

It became apparent that a more permanent and flexible solution is needed for any public Pathfinder guides. The guides here have been publically shared, usually via google drive.

## Usage
If you just want to view guides download the release. It contains only the viewer which will pull all files from the repository. The viewer runs locally using a few basic js scripts so shoudl run in most browsers.

## Structure
Before submitting please check if an existing folder exists. If not please submit with it at root level. As the number of files increases we will handle sorting these files as needed.

## Submission guidelines
Do not submit anything that is not already public/you do not have the rights to submit.
Many folders contain an "_External Links.txt" file to collect links to external sources where permission may not exist to save the file locally. This file is prefixed with an underscore to sort first.
